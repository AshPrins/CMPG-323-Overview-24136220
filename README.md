#### Branching Strategy
Currently I am leaning towards using a "Github Flow" branching strategy. Since I will be working alone this strategy makes sense as I will most likely not be needing "release" branches. I will have a master branch and can create additional feature branches that stem directly from the master without needing to worry about different teams working on different versions.

#### .gitignore file
A .gitignore file will be used if you have already commited something in the past, but you do not need to recommit it again or every time you do another commit. This could be a file where the changes are done and will no longer be edited like library files or object code. This could also be something that you do not want to commit for security reasons, like a file containing sensitive information or passwords etc..

#### Storage of passwords and sensitive information
I will use store my passwords and sensitive information on my local machine and include it in my .gitignore file to ensure this does not get committed to my public repositories.

#### Reference List
Added to this repository as Word document.
