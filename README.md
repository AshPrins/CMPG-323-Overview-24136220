##### .gitignore file
A .gitignore file will be used if you have already commited something in the past, but you do not need to recommit it again or every time you do another commit. This could be a file where the changes are done and will no longer be edited like library files or object code. This could also be something that you do not want to commit for security reasons, like a file containing sensitive information or passwords etc..
